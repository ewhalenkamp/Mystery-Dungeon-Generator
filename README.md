# Mystery-Dungeon-Generator

This program creates a maze using a set number of rooms (roomCount in aaaMain) and a set number of floors (for loop in main method). The algorithm links randomly generated rooms with corridors and spawns an exit somewhere on the floor through which the player can escape. A record of the user's progress is made, and the faster you escape the maze, the better.

The use of random generation in creating each floor makes it so you'll never traverse the same dungeon twice.

Controls:

- W - Up
- A - Left
- S - Down
- D - Right
- Hold Space - Run

Completed as a Fall 2019 term project for CS 160 at the University of Northern Colorado by Erik Halenkamp.
